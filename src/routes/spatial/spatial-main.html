  <h1>Spatial System</h1>
  <p>The goal with ECOS is to provide a cohesive system made of components and spatial system.</p>

  <h1>Current experimentation</h1>
  <p>ECOS is built on FAST, which has a spatial system based on some variables. These are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design Unit (default: 4)</li>
    <li>Density (default: 0)</li>
    <li>Base horizontal spacing multiplier (default: 10)</li>
    <li>Base height multiplie (default: 3)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>From there the idea is to build "components" that provide nice composition. For exemple, a `collection` component that nicely displays cards with the right spacing around the card components.</p>

  <h1>Design system modifiers</h1>
  <p>Sometimes in the spatial story of a page, you need to change a spatial characteristic based on the current contextual situation. For exemple you want the density of components to decrease from the current context. Or you want the base background to go slightly darken or lighten. Here come the idea of a design system modifier.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>densify</li>
  </ul>
  <p>More to come...</p>
