<p>Ecos Design System is built on the amazing work of Microsoft&#39;s FAST UI project. You&#39;ll soon discover the great benefits of Ecos:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s fast.</li>
<li>It&#39;s extensible.</li>
<li>It uses native web-components.</li>
<li>It works in most framework out of the box or with minimal config.</li>
<li>It is well documented (this is a work in progress to be honest right now, but it&#39;s going to be great with many exemples and guides)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="whats-a-design-system-by-the-way-">What&#39;s a design system by the way ?</h1>
<p>Based on a set of <em>Design Tokens</em>, the design system apply a consistent design and user experience on websites or applications. Exemples:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can change the whole <em>coloring</em> scheme of Ecos by changing it&#39;s <code>fillColor</code> <em>Design Token</em>.</li>
<li>you can adjust the <em>rounding</em> of all controls by changing its <code>controlCornerRadius</code> <em>Design Token</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Ecos, you can do this at runtime by changing each Design Token&#39;s value from a Javascript code and everything related to this value will change on the whole website or application.</p>
<h1 id="whats-the-difference-between-fast-and-ecos-">What&#39;s the difference between FAST and ECOS ?</h1>
<p>ECOS is strongly based on FAST. In fact, what Microsoft is building with their FAST project is amazing and fun to work with. They have built</p>
<ul>
<li>a strong foundation of web-components that can easily be customized and extended</li>
<li>a solid <em>Design Token</em> mechanism for managing a whole Design System in a cohesive and extensible way</li>
<li>amazing color methods in order to do color calculations and thus, creating a nice, coherant coloring scheme withouth the need to choose all colors. This includes contrast calculations to ensure a perfect level of accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>However, FAST is designed to be a foundation and has a strong focus on low level components. Ecos is building on top of this to bring a few more useful layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>new web-components aimed at solving common layout and composition needs, such as <code>Section</code>, <code>Collection</code>, <code>Table</code>, <code>Stach</code> components (and more)</li>
<li>new CSS properties setting a nice Spatial System in place. With those properties you can ensure a coherant use of <em>space</em> in your layout</li>
<li>new colors. FAST is very minimalistic in its set of colors in order to stay focus on the low level components. ECOS aims at provided a more complete set of tools and components to help you build a complete UI/UX. Therefore you&#39;ll find more colors and some tweaks to help you bring more creativity in your end-result look and feel.</li>
<li>new low-level components that we found are missing in the FAST project. An exemple is the <em>Date Field</em> component.</li>
</ul>
